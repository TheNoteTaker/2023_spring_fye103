# Module 5.2 - Career Decision-Making

## Notes on Chapter 8

- <https://www.cashcourse.org> is a free website designed for college students
  to keep track of their financial literacy.

### Decision-Making Styles

- **Planning**
    - Considering values, objectives, necessary information, alternatives, and
      consequences; a rational approach with a balance between thinking and
      feeling.
- **Impulsive**
    - Little thought or examination; taking the first available alternative.
- **Intuitive**
    - Automatic, preconscious choice based on inner harmony.
- **Compliant**
    - Non-assertive; letting someone else decide; following someone else's plan.
- **Delaying**
    - Procrastination, avoidance, hoping someone or something will happen to
      avoid making a decision, postponing thought and action.
- **Fatalistic**
    - What will be; letting the environment decide; leaving it up to
      fate.
- **Agonizing**
    - Worrying that a decision will be the wrong one; getting lost in all the
      data; overwhelmed by analyzing alternatives.
- **Paralytic**
    - Complete indecision and fear; accepting responsibility but being unable
      to act on it.
- **Defaulting**
    - Choosing the alternative with the lowest level of risk.

**Planning** and **Intuitive** styles are the most effective.

--- 

When you feel stuck or unable to make a decision, try asking yourself the
following questions:

1. What are my assumptions (attitudes) affecting my decisions
2. What are my feelings regarding these decisions?
3. Why am I clinging behavior that prevents me from making this decision?
4. What further information do I need in order to generate alternatives?

### Conditions For Change

Three things must be present to trigger change:

1. You must be dissatisfied with what is
2. You much have a concept of what would be better
3. You must believe that there is a way to get there

This all works on the premise that the benefits of change outweigh the costs
of making the change.

### A Decision-making Model

The five steps necessary to make an informed and desirable decision are:

1. **Defining your goal**
    - Can you change part of the problem into a definite goal?
    - What do you want to accomplish by what date?
    - Can you state your objective now?
2. **Assessing your alternatives**
    - What are your alternatives or options?
    - Are your alternative choices consistent with your important values?
    - Can you summarize your important values in writing?
    - What is a reasonable amount of time in which to accomplish your
      alternatives?
3. **Gathering information**
    - What do you know about your alternatives?
    - What assumptions are you making that you should check out?
    - What more do you need to know about your alternatives?
    - What sources will help you gather more information about your
      alternatives?
    - What sources will help you discover further alternatives?
4. **Assessing the consequences**
    - Probability:
        - Whatis the probability of the success of each alternative?
        - Are your highest values part of each alternative?
    - Desirability:
        - Can you eliminate the least desirable alternatives first?
        - When you consider the best possible alternative, how much do you want
          it?
        - What are you willing to give up in order to get what you want?
5. **Establishing your plan of action or the steps needed to achieve your goal.
   **
    - Weighing everything you now know about your decision, what is your plan of
      action?
    - What dates will you start and complete your plan of action?
    - Does your plan of action state a clear objective?
    - Does your plan of action specify the steps necessary to achieve its
      objective?
    - Does your plan of action specify the conditions necessary to achieve its
      objective?
