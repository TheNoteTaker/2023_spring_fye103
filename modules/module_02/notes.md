New college students may not immediately realize that they’ve entered a whole
new world at college, including a world of other people possibly very different
from those they have known before. This is a very important dimension of
college—almost as important as the learning that goes on inside the classroom.
How you deal with the social aspects and diversity of college world has a large
impact on your academic success.

The notes intentions were to help you gain insight into the value of making
new friends and getting along with the wide variety of people you will encounter
on campus. Another aim of the chapter was to help you learn why and how a broad
diversity of people enriches the college experience and better prepare you for
the world after college.

Enter this new world with an open mind and you’ll gain many benefits. Even if
you are taking a course or two at night and do not spend much of your day on
campus, try to make the most of this experience. You’ll meet others who will
challenge and stimulate you and broaden your thinking and emotional experiences.
